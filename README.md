# JWKSprojectone3550
I made a JWKS server using go.
I had the assistance of AI on this project. 
The prompt I gave it was basically the entire project requirements however everything was not smooth sailing. I used go as my programming langauge and there was a lot of going back and forth with the ai tool to achieve the goal of getting all 65 points and over 80% on the test coverage.
